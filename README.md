# Dotfiles
![Preview](/previews/dotfiles.jpg)

These are my personal dotfiles, the theme is based on Catppuccin Mocha palette. I use them on my PC with Arch Linux, so they may or may not work on your machine, use them more as a reference and never try to just copy the files to your system without knowing what they do.
